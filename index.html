        <h2>Video</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the world of Rusty Beats 101, an original song composed and produced by me, Daniel Coker under the name Rusty Xof. In this unique and captivating music video, I've combined my passion for music with the power of artificial intelligence to create a mesmerizing visual experience.

To bring the visuals to life, I've utilized multiple AI models, each with its own distinct style and capabilities. By harnessing the creative potential of these cutting-edge technologies, the visuals in this video are not only synchronized with the music but also offer a glimpse into the future of artistic expression.

So, sit back, relax, and immerse yourself in the audiovisual journey of Rusty Beats 101. I hope you enjoy the seamless blend of music, technology, and art as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p>
